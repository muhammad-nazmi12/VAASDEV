VAAS stands for Vehicle Accident Analysis System.

The website system analyzes the number of accidents from daily to year and is able to find any source for the accident issue, such as a website, video, or document. 
The system employs JavaScript and the Django Web Framework for backend programming, as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend programming.
Furthermore, PostgreSQL is the database used on this system. By the way, this system is still in development and is only for my personal use.
